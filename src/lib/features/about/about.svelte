  <p>
    I'm a <span class="font-semibold text-white">software developer</span> with <span class="font-semibold text-white">3 years</span> of experience and a passion for building robust, user-friendly applications. My work spans from
    <span class="font-semibold text-white">machine learning</span>
    and <span class="font-semibold text-white">web development</span> to
    <span class="font-semibold text-white">UI design and 3D modeling</span>. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and expand my skill set. In my free time, I delve into
    <span class="font-semibold text-white">game development</span>, creating engaging and enjoyable gaming experiences.

  <p class="mt-4">
    I keep up with the latest tech trends, enjoy tinkering with gadgets, and occasionally share my insights
    through writing and discussions. I thrive in collaborative environments and am always excited to work with diverse teams,
