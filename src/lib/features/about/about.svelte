	<p>
		I'm a <span class="text-foam-300">software developer</span> who loves building solid,
		user-friendly applications. I've dabbled in everything from
		<span class="text-teal-300">Machine Learning</span>
		to <span class="text-indigo-300">Web Development</span>, and even some
		<span class="text-green-300">UI Design and 3D Modelling</span> I'm always up for learning new
		stuff and expanding my toolkit. On the side, I'm into <span class="text-red-300">game development</span>, using my coding skills
		to whip up some cool and fun gaming experiences 
	</p>
	<p class="mt-4">
		I enjoy keeping a pulse on the latest tech trends, tinkering with gadgets, and occasionally
		sharing my insights through writing and discussions. Collaboration is where I thrive, and I'm
		always excited to work with diverse teams and learn from collective experiences.
