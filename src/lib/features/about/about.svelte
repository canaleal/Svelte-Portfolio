	<p>
		I'm a <span class="text-teal-300">full-Stack software developer</span> with a knack for crafting
		robust, user-centric applications. I've worked with a variety of technologies and frameworks,
		from
		<span class="text-teal-300">Machine Learning</span> to
		<span class="text-teal-300">Web Development</span>, and even some
		<span class="text-teal-300">UI Design and 3D Modelling</span> I'm always looking to expand my skillset
		and try new things.
	</p>
	<p class="mt-4">
		I enjoy keeping a pulse on the latest tech trends, tinkering with gadgets, and occasionally
		sharing my insights through writing and discussions. Collaboration is where I thrive, and I'm
		always excited to work with diverse teams and learn from collective experiences.
