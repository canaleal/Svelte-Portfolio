  <p>
    I'm a <span class="font-bold">software developer</span> who loves building solid, user-friendly applications. I've
    dabbled in everything from
    <span class="font-bold ">Machine Learning</span>
    to <span class="font-bold ">Web Development</span>, and even some
    <span class="font-bold ">UI Design and 3D Modelling</span> I'm always up for learning new stuff and expanding my
    toolkit. On the side, I'm into
    <span class="font-bold ">game development</span>, using my coding skills to whip up some cool and fun gaming
    experiences
  </p>
  <p class="mt-4">
    I enjoy keeping a pulse on the latest tech trends, tinkering with gadgets, and occasionally sharing my insights
    through writing and discussions. Collaboration is where I thrive, and I'm always excited to work with diverse teams
    and learn from collective experiences.
